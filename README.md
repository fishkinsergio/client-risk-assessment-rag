AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that automates risk-assessment responses for IBM SaaS services using IBM Watson embeddings, Milvus vector database, and AWS Bedrock LLMs.
## ⚠️ Important Notice

This repository serves as a **technical portfolio demonstration** of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system I developed for client risk assessment. Due to confidentiality agreements:

- **No proprietary code** from the actual implementation is included
- **No client data** or sensitive information is present
- **Mock implementations** demonstrate architectural patterns and technical decisions
- **Real metrics and outcomes** are generalized or anonymized where included

The code examples here represent the **types of solutions** and **technical approaches** used in the production system, rewritten with synthetic data and generic use cases.
